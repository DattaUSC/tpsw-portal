# TPSW
This is an on-line application to allow management for the companies visiting a college campus for recruitment of full-timers and interns. Basically this application allows students to sign an approval for participating in interviews for different companies. The placement coordinators can have admin rights and add new companies.

The applications features fully dynamic database columns as all companies may require different student information. When a company is added the new information fields are dynamically added to the student collection and all forced to fill in the information.

* Ruby version - 2.3.3

* System dependencies - RubyonRails, MongoDB, a text-editor

## Setting up
1. Clone the app and run `bundle install` .
2. Run `rails s` to start server in development environment since the app uses MongoDB there is no need to run schema migrations.

## Contribution
The application is very new and is obvious to break at some points. Any contributions either be it issues or feature requests are most welcomed.
